# Vision

Vision capabilities enable models to **analyze images and provide insights based on visual content** in addition to text. This multimodal approach opens up new possibilities for applications that require both textual and visual understanding.

We provide a variety of models with vision capabilities, all available via the Chat Completions API.

:::tip
For more specific use cases regarding Document Parsing, OCR and Data Extraction we recommend taking a look at our Document AI stack [here](./document_ai).

### Recommended Models with Vision Capabilities

- **Mistral Large 3** via `mistral-large-2512`
- **Mistral Medium 3.1** via `mistral-medium-2508`
- **Mistral Small 3.2** via `mistral-small-2506`
- **Ministral 3**:
  - Ministral 3 14B via `ministral-14b-2512`
  - Ministral 3 8B via `ministral-8b-2512`
  - Ministral 3 3B via `ministral-3b-2512`

<SectionTab as="h1" sectionId="passing-an-image">Sending an Image</SectionTab>

### Use Vision Models

There are two ways to send an image to the Chat Completions API, either by passing a URL or by passing a base64 encoded image.

:::tip
Before continuing, we recommend reading the [Chat Competions](completion) documentation to learn more about the chat completions API and how to use it before proceeding.

<ExplorerTabs id="passing-an-image">
  <ExplorerTab value="passing-an-image-url" label="Passing an Image URL">
    If the image is hosted online, you can simply provide the **publicaly accessible URL of the image** in the request. This method is straightforward and does not require any encoding.

    If you have an image or a set of images stored locally, you can pass them to the model in **base64 encoded format**. Base64 encoding is a common method for converting binary data into a text format that can be easily transmitted over the internet. This is particularly useful when you need to include images in API requests.

The chart is a bar chart titled 'France's Social Divide,' comparing socio-economic indicators between disadvantaged areas and the whole of France. It comprises two sections: the first section includes three bar groups representing the percentage of people part of the working-class, unemployment rate, and percentage of 16-25-year-olds not in school and unemployed. The second section includes three bar groups representing median monthly income, poverty rate, and households living in overcrowded housing. Each bar group contains two bars: one for disadvantaged areas (red) and one for the whole of France (blue). The data indicate that disadvantaged areas have higher percentages of working-class individuals (33.5% vs. 14.5%), unemployment (18.1% vs. 7.3%), and young people not in school and unemployed (25.2% vs. 12.9%). They also show a lower median monthly income (€1,168 vs. €1,822), a higher poverty rate (43.3% vs. 15.5%), and a higher percentage of households living in overcrowded housing (22.0% vs. 8.7%). The chart highlights significant disparities in socio-economic conditions between disadvantaged areas and the rest of France, emphasizing the challenges faced by these communities.

The two images you provided both feature the Eiffel Tower, but they depict different scenes and perspectives:

1. **First Image:**
  - This image shows a close-up, clear view of the Eiffel Tower from a low angle, emphasizing its intricate iron lattice structure.
  - The background is a clear blue sky, and the focus is solely on the Eiffel Tower itself.
  - There are no other elements such as crowds or sporting events visible.

2. **Second Image:
  - This image captures the Eiffel Tower in the background, but it is part of a larger scene that includes a tennis stadium.
  - The stadium is filled with spectators, indicating a major tennis event, likely the French Open, which is held at Roland Garros in Paris.
  - The Eiffel Tower is visible in the distance behind the stadium, adding a sense of scale and context to the event.
  - The sky is partly cloudy, and the stadium is bustling with activity, contrasting with the serene and solitary depiction of the Eiffel Tower in the first image.

In summary, the first image focuses on the architectural details of the Eiffel Tower, while the second image situates the Eiffel Tower within a lively, crowded sports event setting.

<Faq defaultValue={['price-per-image', 'tokens-per-image']}>
  <FaqItem question="What is the price per image?">

    The price is calculated using the same pricing as input tokens per image, with each image being tokenized.

  </FaqItem>
  <FaqItem question="How many tokens correspond to an image and/or what is the maximum resolution?">

    Depending on the model and resolution, an image will be tokenized differently. Below is a summary.
    
    | Model             | Max Resolution | ≈ Formula                             | ≈ N Max Tokens |
    | ----------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------- |
    | Mistral Large 3   | 1540x1540      | `≈ (ResolutionX * ResolutionY) / 784` | ≈ 3025         |
    | Mistral Small 3.2 | 1540x1540      | `≈ (ResolutionX * ResolutionY) / 784` | ≈ 3025         |
    | Mistral Medium 3  | 1540x1540      | `≈ (ResolutionX * ResolutionY) / 784` | ≈ 3025         |
    | Ministral 3       | 1540x1540      | `≈ (ResolutionX * ResolutionY) / 784` | ≈ 3025         |
    | Pixtral Large     | 1024x1024      | `≈ (ResolutionX * ResolutionY) / 256` | ≈ 4096         |
    | Pixtral 12B       | 1024x1024      | `≈ (ResolutionX * ResolutionY) / 256` | ≈ 4096         |
    
    If the resolution of the image sent is higher than the maximum resolution of the model, the image will be downscaled to its maximum resolution. An error will be sent if the resolution is higher than **10000x10000**.

  </FaqItem>
  <FaqItem question="Can I fine-tune the image capabilities?">

    Yes, you can fine-tune pixtral-12b.

  </FaqItem>
  <FaqItem question="Can I use them to generate images?">
